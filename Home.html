        <p class="backgroundsize">I am so humbled that you stopped by to learn more about me as a photographer. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Haley and I have always had a passion for photography. I am married to a wonderful husband who always supports me in every way. We have been blessed with an amazing little boy. It wasn't until our son was born that I realized I had a true passion for photography. I love capturing precious memories that you can hold onto forever. I thank God for those sweet moments everyday. I always knew I wanted to help people in life. I started out with a career in Respiratory Therapy. The best part of that career was being able to help others. I just didn't quite feel that path was mine to take. The more I began taking photos of milestones and precious memories, the more I realized photography was my calling.
             I want to help people preserve moments in time that pass us by too quickly. I would be honored to help you capture memories you can reminisce on.</p>
